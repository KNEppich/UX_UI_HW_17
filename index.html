<h3> Welcome. And before you ask, although you likely already have, there is a reason I’m wearing an apron in this picture. The truth is what brought me to UX/UI design was career in food media and recipe development. An unlikely combination maybe, but i’s actually a perfect recipe.
    Having spent many years in the food media industry, the key lesson I learned was the importance of structured communication. You can create the best recipe in the world, but if you don’t communicate it properly, make it easy to make and approachable for the cook, they simply won’t make it.
    This is the same approach I bring to UX/UI design. I look to bring to life those endless good ideas for small businesses, non-profit organizations and dreamers just getting started. My goal as a designer is to find the best and simplest path to your end goal - with a few delights along the way.
